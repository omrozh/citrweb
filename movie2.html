        <b style="color: red;">Soundtrack:</b> 
        The soundtrack incorporates elements of modern and 90s metal music as well as elements from the original soundtrack. It mainly focuses on the emotional impact the music creates. It includes songs that are allusions to the narrative as well as allusions to Holden’s evolving emotional state. One can also sense pieces of Salinger’s life within the playlist. To be clear, this soundtrack is intended for the novel and not the film.

        <b style="color: red;">Far From Over:</b> 
        The main purpose this piece has in this soundtrack is to allude to the disco and club scenes in the novel.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="color: red;">In The Army Now:</b> 
        This piece is included to allude to Salinger’s time in the army. As Salinger’s military experience forms an important part of the story (for example, the scene where Holden is “praying” to Allie as he crosses the sidewalk), we found it fit to include this piece in the soundtrack.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="color: red;">Fade To Black:</b> 
        Though this piece was actually an exaggerated throwback to the group’s (Metallica) stolen instruments, it is still a very depressed/melancholy song. In fact, a grotesque fact about the piece is that it was sometimes played in suicides and was thusly accused of promoting suicidal thoughts in teenagers. Though Holden is not suicidal throughout the novel, he is still quite depressed, making this song a good fit for the soundtrack.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="color: red;">Dyers Eve:</b>
        This piece is very harsh and contains swear words. Even these facts alon tie it into “The Catcher In The Rye,” in that they allude to Holden’s conflicting and unstable inner world. Yet, there are still more allusions that come in the form of lyrics. For example, the word “Hell” is repeated throughout the song, and we see contempt against adults as a main theme in the song as well. “Hell” connotes negativity and even depression, as the person singing the song is going “through” it. Their parents are blamed for this, revealing the contempt the singer holds against adults. Both of these tie into frequent thoughts Holden has about what he is going through and what he thinks of adults, making the song a good fit.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="color: red;">Travelling:</b>
        We incorporated this piece into the soundtrack to add some soft music into the mix. Also, the rhythm (“right, left, right, left, right, left”) -- and also the title -- make the listener feel like they are taking steps down a road. As Holden himself is taking a spiritual -- arguably physical -- journey into adulthood, this piece links well with “The Catcher In The Rye”.
