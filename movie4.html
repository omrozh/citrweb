        <b style="color: red;">To Live Is To Die:</b> 
        This piece can be interpreted as a conflict between innocence and maturity, the two different tones in the piece being diametric opposites of each other: one melody is soft and innocent, while the other descends slowly and somewhat ‘menacingly,’ and is much harsher and darker than the initial melody. The piece transitions between these tones, ending with the innocent one. These changes of tones connect to the conflict between innocence and maturity as portrayed through Holden in the book.

        This piece is also a throwback to Salinger’s days in the army, yet it has a somewhat more epic look at war, instead giving the feel of a piece that would be performed to raise morale in the trenches. It has been included to show the other, more epic, way of seeing war.

        <b style="color: red;">One:</b> 
        This piece takes on the condition of a wounded war veteran (of the Vietnam War). Towards the end, the melody gets extremely harsh and fast, connoting the unstable state of mind of the veteran. Both the topic of the song and it’s melody connects with both the change in Salinger’s psychology after he experienced WWII and Holden’s psychology in the aftermath of his inner conflict between preserving his innocence and becoming an adult, wherein he finds himself in a mental health facility.

        <b style="color: red;">To Hell and Back:</b>
        This piece, also, is a throwback to Salinger’s time in the army, which was a very important factor in shaping the way the novel came out. It can also be considered an allusion to the scene in which Holden is running across sidewalks the way a soldier would be running across trenches.
