        <b style="color: red;">Dream No More:</b> 
        This piece is originally about “Ctulhu,” a Lovecraftian entity (There should be a C instead of K, but the band decided to write C for copyright reasons). Yet the “monster” in this piece can also be interpreted as maturity -- as Holden sees it throughout the majority of the novel. The prospect of losing the battle for his innocence and becoming an adult drives Holden mad, the way “Ctulhu” drives anyone mortal who views him mad.

        <b style="color: red;">Wake Up:</b> 
        Throughout the novel, Holden fears the loss of innocence. He is frightened by the concept of growing up. This piece is generally based on the concepts of waking up/growing up. Holden doesn’t want to face the reality of the modern world, every individual has to grow up. However, towards the end of the novel, he seems to accept how he has to move on from the past which he desperately tries to hold onto.

        <b style="color: red;">Who Wrote Holden Caulfield:</b> 
        This piece would fit nicely into our novel and the soundtrack since it is about Holden Caulfield and the whole story of Catcher in the Rye. The song explains Holden’s character, his behavior and his lifestyle.

        <b style="color: red;">Who will save world:</b>
        Mirroring what Salinger experiences in WWII, this piece is about young soldiers pushed into a gruesome battle, despte still struggling to grow up and accept the relities of the adult world. Note that because of its use in the documentary: "Afghanistan- A Soviet Experience", the song has always been associated with the soviet afghan war ever since.

        In the first verses of the song, 2pac mainly talks about many of the problems in the corrupt, ‘phony’ adult world. He says how society includes racism, there are drug dealers dealing for children, suicidal individuals, robbers, murderers, etc. The most important part of the song is the line “I’d love to go back to when we played as kids, But things change… and that’s the way it is.” He wishes to go back to the innocence of childhood, but he realizes that everyone has to grow up and change. Holden also acknowledges these terrifying aspects of modern life, and avoids them, but unlike 2pac, he is unable to understand how things change, and that’s the way it is.
