        <b style="color: red;">Plot:</b> The movie follows a now grown-up Holden as he tries to help Phoebe deal with problems to his own past-self. Holden is still present with his general appearance, with his iconic red hunting hat etc. etc. but we have stripped away all his “problems and defects,” engineering a mature character. 

        Everything starts when Phoebe accidentally falls to Hudson river head first (we don’t know how), causing irreversible brain damage. 

        Holden, hearing about this, decides to leave his school for holiday three days earlier. Thankfully, Phoebe responds to preliminary treatment just fine, just requiring psychological assistance to adapt to her new life with mental disability. So, Holden, giving up his extremely successful academic life in Harvard, decides to assist her little sister through this painstaking process. 

        But the benign brain tumor he previously made up as a lie appears to be very real and to have caused metastasis. He conceals this “little secret” from her sister until the point of no return, leading to a tragic end.

        <b style="color: red;">Characterization:</b> The characters are very well done and are easy to connect with. Each character feels likeable and you start to bond with them. Phoebe’s story is relatable and feels plausible and it’s great to see Holden apply the lessons he learned in the previous story to his and her life. As Phoebe’s transition crisis comes in different areas of life than did Holden’s, the film has the opportunity to explore new subject matter.
