            <b style="color: red;">Hunting Hat:</b>
            <br>
            The red hunting hat is a symbol of Holden's confidence and also his innocence. It is used as a motif in the bildungsroman as it is repeated throughout. When Holden takes it on or off, his character changes, and when he at last puts it on, it signifies that he has accepted reality as it is and is confidently striding towards adulthood.

            <b style="color: red;">The Pond and The Ducks:</b>
            <br>
            The pond and the ducks are a motif in “The Catcher In The Rye”.  It symbolizes Holden’s search for a path to take when he finally transitions into adulthood. As it is also a peculiar thing for a person to mull over, it symbolizes the childlike innocence Holden still nurtures within him as him thinking about where the ducks go when the pond freezes up signifies a childlike curiosity.

            <br>
            <b style="color: red;">The National History Museum:</b>
            <br>
            The National History Museum and Holden’s fondness for it symbolises Holden’s resistance to change and his like for isolation. Holden hates adulthood and fears becoming an adult. Thus viewing the specimens in the museum frozen in the time of their death unchanging through the centuries gives him comfort. Similarly he isn’t bothered or asked questions in the museum and doesn’t have to interact with other people.

            <br>
            <b style="color: red;">“FU” Graffiti:</b>
            <br>
            Holden tries to erase the graffiti on the wall of Phoebe’s school. He does this because he believes that the children inside will lose their innocence if they see it.
