        <b style="color: red;">Moth Into Flame:</b> 
        This piece mostly criticises how  “everyone has [an] obsession with […] being popular. ” As in the bildungsroman Holden also avoids popularity himself, instead choosing to isolate himself from society, this piece connects well with his outlook towards life.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="color: red;">Promises:</b> 
        This piece is built on a Romeo and Juliet type love story including two individuals who are in love but cannot be together, as they are kept apart from each other, they make a promise to meet each other in the ‘Next Life’. “I will meet you in the next life, I promise you.” This can be compared to Holden’s relationship with Jane, wherein he can’t even call her, even though he clearly has some sort of affection for her. He can’t be with her, and we don’t even meet her in the story, the way the lovers can’t get together in “Promises”.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="color: red;">Enter Sandman:</b> 
        Though this piece is not originally about the loss of innocence but about crib death, yet it also ties into the loss of innocence. The sandman’s entry, and it “killing” the child can be interpreted as the adult world killing the “child” in a teenager, thus connecting it to the theme of the teenager’s transition to adulthood in the novel.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="color: red;">Frayed Ends Of Sanity:</b>
        This piece is quite explicitly about how one loses one’s sanity. The piece follows the order in which madness comes about, and we see that happen with Holden as well. He fails school, and as he searches for an exit, a way through life in which he preserves his innocence, he becomes increasingly unstable until the novel’s climax, where he finally accepts adulthood. This doesn’t stop him from ultimately ending up in a mental health facility. Thus, this piece follows Holden’s story in the novel, making it a good addition into our playlist.
